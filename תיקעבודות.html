            <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted 
                <br>by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
                <br> The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters 
                <br> as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
                <br> Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text
                <br>>and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
                <br>uncover many web sites still in their infancy. 
                <br>Various versions have evolved over the years 
                <br> sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                  What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                   <br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                   <br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                   <br>  It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                   <br>  unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                   <br>  and more recently with desktop publishing software 
                   <br>  like Aldus PageMaker including versions of<P class="redline"> Lorem Ipsum</P>.

                <p>
                 <br>   There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, 
                 <br>  but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour,
                 <br>   or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.
                 <br>  If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing
                 <br>  hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined
                 <br>  chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over
                 <br>   200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which
                 <br>  looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour,
                 <br>   or non-characteristic words etc.
